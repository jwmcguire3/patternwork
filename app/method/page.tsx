        <h2>The Patternwork Method</h2>
        <p>
          Patternwork is a method for identifying, regulating, and reorganizing
          the internal patterns that shape your states, responses, and identity.
        </p>
        <p>
          It focuses on four layers: state patterns, protector patterns,
          attachment patterns, and identity patterns. Together, these describe
          how your internal system operates under stress, closeness, and change.
        </p>
        <p>
          This page will eventually walk through the full model — identify,
          regulate, reorganize, integrate — with examples and diagrams. For now,
          it serves as a clearer written explanation of what Patternwork is and
          how it differs from standard personality tests or symptom checklists.
