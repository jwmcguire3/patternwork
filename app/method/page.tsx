        <h2>The Patternwork Method</h2>

        <p>
          Patternwork is a method for identifying, regulating, and reorganizing
          the internal patterns that shape your states, responses, and identity.
          It is not a type system or diagnosis. It is a structured way to see
          how your system actually operates.
        </p>

        <h3>1. Identify</h3>
        <p>
          First, Patternwork maps the patterns you describe across four layers:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>State patterns</strong> – how your nervous system moves
            between activation, shutdown, and mixed states.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Protector patterns</strong> – how parts manage threat,
            loss, conflict, and overwhelm.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Attachment patterns</strong> – how you regulate closeness,
            distance, and emotional risk with other people.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Identity patterns</strong> – roles, habits, and narrative
            loops that shape how you move through your life.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2. Regulate</h3>
        <p>
          Once patterns are visible, Patternwork focuses on regulation. The goal
          is not to erase states or protectors, but to give your system more
          options when it starts to spin up or shut down.
        </p>
        <p>
          Regulation tools are chosen to match your actual patterns, not generic
          advice. If your system tends to mobilize, collapse, or flip between
          the two, the tools reflect that.
        </p>

        <h3>3. Reorganize</h3>
        <p>
          Over time, repeated regulation and clearer awareness allow deeper
          reorganization. This is where identity and role patterns begin to
          shift: how you show up in conflict, in closeness, in work, and in
          how you talk to yourself.
        </p>
        <p>
          The method looks at how states, protectors, attachment responses, and
          identity habits interact, instead of treating them as separate issues.
        </p>

        <h3>4. Integrate</h3>
        <p>
          Patternwork is meant to be used alongside therapy, coaching, or your
          own reflective work. The Profile and Companion give you language and
          structure so you can carry the insights into real conversations and
          real decisions.
        </p>

        <p>
          The goal is a system that can recognize itself, regulate more
          reliably, and act in ways that match what actually matters to you.
