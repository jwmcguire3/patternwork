        <p>
          The Patternwork Companion is designed to help you work with your
          Profile over time, not just read it once and forget it.
        </p>
        <p>
          It uses the same structure as your assessment results — states,
          protectors, attachment, identity — to help you interpret what&apos;s
          happening in your system and choose regulation or reconstruction tools
          that fit your patterns.
        </p>
        <p>
          In practice, the Companion will live as a structured GPT experience
          that understands the Patternwork Method and can respond in the same
          exact language and categories used in your Profile.
