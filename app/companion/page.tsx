        <h2>The Patternwork Companion</h2>

        <p>
          The Patternwork Companion exists so your Map doesn't become
          something you read once and forget. It is designed to speak the same
          language as your Patternwork Assessment and keep using it in daily
          life.
        </p>

        <h3>What the Companion does</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Helps you interpret what's happening in your system in
            real time.
          </li>
          <li>
            Reflects patterns back to you using the same categories as your
            Map: states, protectors, attachment, identity.
          </li>
          <li>
            Suggests regulation tools that fit your actual patterns, not generic
            tips.
          </li>
        
        </ul>

        <h3>How it works</h3>
        <p>
          The Companion is a structured GPT experience that knows the
          Patternwork Method. It holds your Map, uses the same
          pattern language, and helps you experiment with new responses without
          losing the structure.
        </p>

        <p>
          It is not a therapist, coach, or crisis service. It is a way to keep
          your internal map active, so you don't have to rebuild the same
          insight from scratch every time your system spikes.
        </p>

        <h3>Who it's for</h3>
        <p>
          The Companion is for people who want more than a one-time assessment.
          It is for people who want a clear, repeatable way to understand what
          their system is doing and how to work with it.
