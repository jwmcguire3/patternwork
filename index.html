  <!-- WHAT PATTERNWORK DOES -->
  <section class="section-alt" id="what">

      <h2>What Patternwork Does</h2>

      <div class="grid-3">
        <div class="card">
          <h3>Identify</h3>
          <p>
            Your system repeats itself. Patternwork maps those patterns across states,
            parts, protectors, and narratives — so you can see what’s actually driving
            your reactions.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <h3>Regulate</h3>
          <p>
            Your nervous system and protectors move through predictable loops.
            Patternwork gives you tools to stabilize those shifts and interrupt
            autopilot responses.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <h3>Reorganize</h3>
          <p>
            Identity, attachment, and role patterns shape how you think and connect.
            Patternwork helps you reorganize the deeper structure so your system stops
            pulling in different directions.

  <!-- HOW IT WORKS -->
  <section class="section" id="method">
    <div class="container narrow">
      <h2>How Patternwork Works</h2>

      <p>
        Patternwork maps the internal patterns you describe through a structured
        assessment and shows you how they interact.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>A clear pattern map of your states, protectors, and loops</li>
        <li>A regulation profile showing how your system stabilizes and destabilizes</li>
        <li>Identity and role patterns influencing long-term behavior</li>
        <li>Integration tools that help you work with your system instead of against it</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        The goal isn’t a type or label. The goal is coherence — a system that can
        understand itself.
      </p>
    </div>
  </section>

  <!-- ASSESSMENT -->
  <section class="section-alt" id="assessment">
    <div class="container narrow">
      <h2>The Patternwork Assessment</h2>

      <p>The Assessment identifies patterns in four areas:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>State Patterns</strong> — how your nervous system moves through
          activation, shutdown, and mixed states.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Protector Patterns</strong> — how parts manage threat, loss, and overwhelm.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Attachment Patterns</strong> — how you regulate closeness, distance,
          and emotional risk.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Identity Patterns</strong> — roles, habits, and narrative loops that
          shape how you move through your life.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        Your answers generate a Patternwork Profile — a map of how your internal system
        is organized.
      </p>

      <!-- Anchor for internal jumps; later you can replace hrefs with /assessment -->
      <div id="assessment-start"></div>

      <div class="hero-actions">
        <a href="/assessment" class="btn">Start the Assessment</a>
      </div>
    </div>

  <!-- COMPANION -->
  <section class="section" id="companion">
    <div class="container narrow">
      <h2>The Patternwork Companion</h2>

      <p>
        The Companion helps you apply what you learn from your Patternwork Profile.
        It supports you with:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Real-time interpretations of your states</li>
        <li>Explanations for why certain patterns activate</li>
        <li>Regulation tools tailored to your system</li>
        <li>Pattern-focused practices for shifting old responses</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        It’s not therapy. It’s a structured way to work with your internal system with
        clarity and precision.
      </p>
    </div>
  </section>

  <!-- WHY PATTERNS MATTER -->
  <section class="section-alt" id="why-patterns-matter">
    <div class="container narrow">
      <h2>Why Patterns Matter</h2>

      <p>Patterns help explain:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Why the same reactions repeat in different contexts</li>
        <li>Why relationships follow familiar loops</li>
        <li>Why goals collapse at predictable stages</li>
        <li>Why regulation is easier in some situations than others</li>
        <li>Why identity can feel stable at times and fragile at others</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Once the pattern is visible, it can be changed. Patternwork gives you the
        structure to do that with accuracy instead of guesswork.

      <h2>Begin Patternwork</h2>
      <p>
        Start with the assessment or learn the method. Either way, the work begins
        with seeing your patterns clearly.

        Patternwork is an educational and reflective framework. It is not a diagnosis
        and does not replace therapy or medical care.
